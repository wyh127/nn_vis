In this project, we will learn different ways of visualizing and using data gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images and class visualizations. We will use PyTorch (works with v0.3.1) throughout this project. The project is based on the following three papers:

1. [Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. "Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps", ICLR Workshop 2014.]
2. [Szegedy et al, "Intriguing properties of neural networks", ICLR 2014]
3. [Yosinski et al, "Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization", ICML 2015 Deep Learning Workshop]
